# dual-checker-

This program scrapes the Georgia dual enrollment course directory.

It finds the prequisites behind each course, and then helps see how that course will transfer to a college.

This program also takes AP scores and sees how your credits will transfer.

-Not going to bother with scraping the AP test credit policies for each college.

-can't scrape colleges that don't have a public course equivalency tool. Can try using gatracs, but that requires authentication and I'd rather not go through all of that.

-going to try to figure out a way to parse degree requirements, but it's most likely going to be that all of this stuff is written

-This is going probably going to be a nightmare to maintain in the future
